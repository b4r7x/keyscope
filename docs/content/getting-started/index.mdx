---

keyscope provides keyboard navigation hooks for React 19 applications. Zero external dependencies, ~1.5 KB gzipped.

## Hook Categories

keyscope has two categories of hooks, each with a different install model:

### Standalone Hooks

These work independently with no provider or runtime dependency. They are copied into your project as local source files via `keyscope add --mode copy`.

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useNavigation` | Arrow key list navigation with Enter/Space selection |
| `useFocusTrap` | Trap Tab focus within a container (modals, dialogs) |
| `useScrollLock` | Prevent body/element scrolling with concurrent lock support |

### Provider-Dependent Hooks

These require `KeyboardProvider` context and are installed as a package dependency via `keyscope add --mode package`.

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useKey` | Register scoped hotkey handlers (single key, array, or key map) |
| `useScope` | Push/pop keyboard scope for layered handler execution |
| `useScopedNavigation` | Navigation within the active scope only |
| `useFocusZone` | Multi-zone focus with arrow key transitions between zones |

## Integration with diff-ui

diff-ui components are visual-only and can optionally integrate keyscope hooks for keyboard accessibility. When both registries are configured, keyboard-enabled diff-ui components install keyscope hooks automatically through `registryDependencies`.
