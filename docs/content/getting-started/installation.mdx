description: Install keyscope hooks with the keyscope CLI or via shadcn registry namespaces.

keyscope is a hooks-first keyboard accessibility toolkit for React.

## Option A: keyscope CLI

Initialize once in your app:

```bash
npx keyscope init
```

Install hooks as local source files:

```bash
npx keyscope add navigation
npx keyscope add focus-trap
npx keyscope add scroll-lock
```

By default, the hooks are copied into your `@/hooks` directory and stay fully editable.

## Option B: shadcn Registry

Add the keyscope namespace to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@keyscope": {
      "url": "https://<your-diffgazer-domain>/r/keyscope/{name}.json"
    }
  }
}
```

Install hooks with shadcn:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @keyscope/navigation
npx shadcn@latest add @keyscope/focus-trap
npx shadcn@latest add @keyscope/scroll-lock
```

## Integrating with diff-ui

When your `components.json` also includes `@diffui`, keyboard-enabled diff-ui components can install keyscope hooks automatically through `registryDependencies`.

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@diffui": {
      "url": "https://<your-diffgazer-domain>/r/diff-ui/{name}.json"
    },
    "@keyscope": {
      "url": "https://<your-diffgazer-domain>/r/keyscope/{name}.json"
    }
  }
}
```
