```bash
npx keyscope remove navigation
npx keyscope remove focus-trap scroll-lock
```

## Useful flags

- `--dry-run`: preview removals only
- `-y, --yes`: skip confirmation prompt
- `--cwd <path>`: run in another project root

## Behavior

- Removes only files owned by selected hooks.
- Keeps shared files required by remaining installed hooks.
- Shows potential orphaned npm dependencies.
